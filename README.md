# Instagram Tool
* using instaloader*

## What it does so far
- download captions and save them to a json file

## What I want to implement later
- download stories
- download replies
- download posts (in a certain range)
- download reels
- use it to not only mass download (maybe paste a single url to download a specific reel for example)
- log into your own account to gain more functionality
